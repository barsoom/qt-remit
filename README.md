# Remit client in Qt

## What does it do?

At the moment: Show you www.example.com and the github start page.

## What should it do when it's 'done'?

Pretty much the same things as ex-remit's fluid.app setup or MacRemit.

## Why a third client?

Because the other two are macOS-exclusive and one bold developer had to use Linux.

## Is it any good?

Yes.
